Steps to set up the Backend
- Clone the backend to project folder looking like this -> ASTARTE : app, backend (While cloning be careful since both the app and backend is named astarte in the repo)
- After creating a virtual environment write 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
- Install mmdetection from gitHub and put it in backendcore
- Open a checkpoints folder under mmdetection
- conda install pytorch torchvision OR pip install pytorch torchvision -> In case of an unkown pytorch error use torch instead
- pip install -U openmim
- mim install mmcv-full
- cd mmdetection
- pip install -v -e .
- Finally, create a .env file under backendapp and ask for a secret key from those who have it
